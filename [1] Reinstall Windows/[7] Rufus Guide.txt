How to Use Rufus.

Open up Run (Win+R) 
Type in MSinfo32 > Check BIOS Mode

If it says UEFI use these settings:
Partition scheme GPT. 
Target system UEFI (non CSM)
File System: FAT32

If it says legacy, use these settings: 
Partition scheme: MBR. 
Target system: BIOS (or UEFI- CSM)
File System: NTFS

If you set it to NTFS then you will need to Disable Secure Boot in Bios.
