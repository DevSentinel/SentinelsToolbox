If your adapter isn't any of those then search on google for your adapter name till you find the drivers.

If you still cant find the drivers - Download CPU-Z from this link (http://www.filedropper.com/cpu-z)
Open it, and go to Mainboard tab and beside "Model" you are going to see your motherboard name
Search that up on google and type "Drivers" bneside it and then click the official link and download the drivers from there.
